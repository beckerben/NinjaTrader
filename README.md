# NinjaTrader Tests
Sandbox for NinjaTrader strategies &amp; experiments  The ultimate goal of my experimentation is a trading bot which trades the futures markets without emotion and following strict rules.  The files here are snippets of experiments to prove or disprove theories as part of this endeavor. 

## Disclaimers
A few disclaimers here.  I almost made this repository private but opted to make it open in case anyone stumbles here and sees something which may be of use or value and opens the door for collaboration.  If something here spawns an idea and you have some success or want to run a few things by someone, give me a shout, I'm a huge fan of synergy!


* The code here is for experimental and educational purposes only. 
* I am not a financial advisor, nor do I give financial advice. 
* The code here is developed for NinjaTrader 8.  I've toyed with many backtesting & automated trading platforms and this is the one I have settled on for this effort. 
* The code here is solely tested for futures markets, usually MNQ. 
* Do not live trade with anything you find here, or do so at your own risk.  If you do and make some money, please feel free to donate some to me!
* Feel free to contribute to any piece of code here.  
* Code files are completely independent and are individual experiments either based on something I have seen, read or dreamed up to see if there's anything of viable. 
* The code here could be incomplete or full of bugs.  It may be untested and raw and will be in the last state I left it which may not even compile.
* Basically, no warranties here, view & use at your own peril.
